## Introduction

An imitated bilibili, only front-end part. It's originally developed as my winter assessment work. You can also get corresponding back-end codes [here](https://github.com/theognis/bilibili).

## Features

- Pure Vanilla JS
- Zero Configuration
- No Extra Dependicies

## Run

Now you can visit this website at https://anonym.ink or https://theognis.github.io/ (well in fact the static assets of the latter one may be blocked by Alibaba Cloud Service on account of anti-leech policy). In case one day both of those mentioned above were unavailable, you could also run the back-end project on your server or just on localhost, and then run this project on a static server. Just make sure to replace all strings like `https://anonym.ink` to your hostname, or add a proxy manually to redirect them.
